HIGHER-ORDER DRAFT FILES --- ALL KNOWN FEATURES IN TEST FILES ARE WORKING

The parser prints out parse trees so you can see if it parses
your favorite HOL sentence the way you'd like.
Type "hotptp-yl-parser-verbose < setops.ax" for example.

hotptp-bnf2.txt   (Version 2.11)

The BNF2-style description, modified from 3.1.1.13d version of TPTP description.
FO/diffs-Feb11 shows the diffs to include all the higher-order features.

make hotptp       generates hotptp-yl-parser from hotptp-bnf2.txt

hotptp-yl-parser            Linux Intel Xeon executable (exit code only)

Wed Feb  1 2006.  Version 0.3 placed on Internet.
Sat Feb  4 2006.  Version 0.4 placed on Internet.
Sun Feb  5 2006.  Version 0.4 bnf w. updated translation placed on Internet.

Wed Feb  8 2006.  Version 0.5 with all known HOF features working to Internet.
Mon Feb 13 2006.  Version 0.6 with all known HOF features working to Internet.
                  Also syntaxBNF-3.1.1.13b.txt and scripts, Makefile.
Mon Feb 20 2006.  Version 2.9 with all known HOF features working to Internet.
                  Also updated scripts, Makefile, sample.txt.
Tue Feb 21 2006.  Incorporates <hof definition> using infix := .
Wed Feb 22 2006.  Recognizes old-syntax, keeping in step with 3.1.1.13c.
                  syntaxBNF2-3.1.1.13c.txt tested and posted also.
Mon Mar 20 2006.  Comments are no longer tokens.  In-line comments accepted.
                  New parser prints all comments in verbose mode.
                  New lex-er stores all comments in a global array along with
                  token strings, so the order in input file is preserved.
                  sample_inline.txt is a test file for both kinds of comments.

Mon Feb 21 23:02 PST 2006:  hotptp-yl-parser 2.8 worked correctly on all
files in TPTP-v3.1.1/Problems/*/, showing backward compatibility.

setops.ax

lambda encoding of axioms for set operations, following ESHOL 2005 Workshop
paper by Benzmuller, Sorge, Jamnik, and Kerber.
This file uses = for definitions, which might lead to semantic problems
but it provides tests for the syntax.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hof-thof1-examples.txt

The examples from http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/TPTP/Proposals/HOL.html
with syntax and semantic updates based on emails from Chad Brown and
Chris Benzmuller.  The parentheses that would be implied by
associativity of @ (left), -> (right), and : (right) have been removed.
Operators used as bare constants are enclosed in parentheses (this gives
Prolog a fighting chance, too).
Definitions using := are demonstrated.  Spaces were inserted after colons
where there was no whitespace, to conform to TPTP requirements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hof-thof2-examples.txt

The examples from http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/TPTP/Proposals/HOL.html
in the second part of the page, which use a moderately different set of
conventions.  Parentheses are added around the arguments of = in
several places.  Unbalanced parentheses in the first sentence are corrected.
Spaces were inserted after colons where there was no whitespace.
This file uses = for definitions, which might lead to semantic problems
but it provides tests for the syntax.

hotptp-1.lex0
hotptp-1.y

The "source" files converted from hotptp-bnf2.txt.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERATING PARSERS

On Red Hat Fedora Linux, Intel Xeon the commands in Makefile were used
to generate the executable parsers.  NOTE: LANG=C is important.
On Linux, lex points to flex anyway; note "-l" in the command.
"bison -y" and "flex -l" should work in place of lex and yacc.
The warning outputs shown are acceptable.

Various intermediate files that are of interest only for debugging
parser generation at another site, or from a different bnf2 file, are
in the directory Intermediates/.

% yacc -d -v hotptp-1.y
yacc: 75 rules never reduced
yacc: 4 shift/reduce conflicts

% lex -l hotptp-1.lex0
"hotptp-1.lex0", line 61: warning, dangerous trailing context
.... (about 20 more lines like this)

% gcc -g  -o hotptp-yl-parser lex.yy.c y.tab.c -ly -ll
% gcc -g  -DP_VERBOSE=1 -o hotptp-yl-parser-verbose lex.yy.c y.tab.c -ly -ll

On IRIX and probably Solaris
% lex hotptp-1.lex0
"hotptp-1.lex0":line XX: Warning: Non-portable Character Class
.... (a few lines like this)

ON SGI Irix and Sun Solaris, the same compile method works, except
no "-l" flag to lex, and I used cc instead of gcc.  Maybe gcc is OK too.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

sample.txt      is a short fof test file (no hof constructs) with these lines:

fof(1,axiom, foo(X,Y,h(Y,Z)), unknown).
fof(2,axiom, bar(X,Y,h(Y,Z)) != baz(h(Y,Z), Y,X), unknown).
fof(status,status,X=1,theory(ac),[status(tau)]).
cnf(include,file,(X=1|X=2),file('mary.txt',harry),[status(tau)]).
include('fred.txt',[1,3]).
fof(3,equality,'Mary'("\"Queen\" of \\Scots\\")='1',introduced(axiom_of_choice,[status(uns)])).
/* $$ Sample: multi-line
 * system comment.
 */
/* multi-line
 * comment.
 */

NUM284-1.010.rm           old-syntax cnf file
SYN007+1.005.rm           old-syntax fof file

The parsers understand these now, Feb. 22, 2006.

syntaxBNF2-3.1.1.13b.txt  is based on email from geoff, Version 3.1.1.13,
with minor changes to give syntaxBNF-3.1.1.13b.txt, after which it was
updated to use BNF2 and the new scripts.  This is the FOF base from which
hotptp-bnf2.txt was developed (but lacks explanantory comments about BNF2).
syntaxBNF2-3.1.1.13c.txt enables old-syntax files to be parsed as well.
syntaxBNF2-3.1.1.13d.txt removes <comment> and <system comment> as alternatives
for <TPTP input> and changes their token rules into macro rules.

make tptp       generates tptp-yl-parser from syntaxBNF2-3.1.1.13c.txt.

Wed Feb 22 21:52:05 PST 2006: tptp-yl-parser worked correctly on all
files in TPTP-v3.1.1/Problems/*/ including the two old-syntax files listed
above.

EVERYTHING AFTER THIS IS CHECKPOINTED IN FO/ and FO.tar AND IS NOT CURRENT
FOR THE NEW SCRIPTS, WHICH EXPECT BNF2 FORMAT.  --- Feb 20, 2006.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

syntaxBNF-3.1.1.13b.txt is based on email from geoff, Version 3.1.1.13.
Minor bug fixed on Feb  4, 2006.
Misc. changes on Feb. 11 and name changed to 13b.

It was fed into scripts to produce syntaxBNF-1.lex0 and syntaxBNF-1.y.

On Red Hat Fedora Linux, Intel Xeon (where lex points to flex, note "-l"),
tptp-yl-parser was compiled as follows from syntaxBNF-1.lex0 and syntaxBNF-1.y

lex -l syntaxBNF-1.lex0
yacc -d -v syntaxBNF-1.y
gcc -g -o tptp-yl-parser lex.yy.c y.tab.c -ly -ll

It reads stdin.  E.g., "tptp-yl-parser < sample.txt".

It outputs "syntax error" and exits on an error, with exit status 1.
On success there is no output to stdout and the exit status is 0.

tptp-yl-parser-verbose was compiled as follows (after running lex and yacc):

gcc -g -DP_VERBOSE=1 -o tptp-yl-parser-verbose lex.yy.c y.tab.c -ly -ll

It outputs parse trees on stdout.
Not much help on locating a syntax error; try running in gdb maybe.

Sun Feb  5 2006.  Version 3.1.1.13 fixed bnf w. updated translation
placed on Internet.

Sun Feb  5 21:33:18 PST 2006: tptp-yl-parser worked correctly on all
files in TPTP-v3.1.1/Problems/*/.
