%----Version 3.1.1.13 (TPTP version.internal development number)
%----Intended uses of the various parts of the TPTP syntax are explained
%----in the TPTP technical manual, linked from www.tptp.org.
%----See the <comment> entries regarding text that can be discarded before 
%----tokenizing for this syntax.
%----White space is almost irrelevant, but, for the Prolog people, all tokens
%----consisting of non-alphanumeric characters shuold be followed bya space.

%----Files. Empty file is OK.

<formula role>       ::= axiom |
                         hypothesis |
                         definition |
                         lemma |

%----"axiom"s are accepted, without proof, as a basis for proving "conjecture"s 
%----and "lemma_conjecture"s in FOF problems. In CNF problems "axiom"s are 
%----accepted as part of the set whose satisfiability has to be established.
%----There is no guarantee that the axioms of a problem are consistent.
%----"hypothesis"s are assumed to be true for a particular problem, and are 
%----used like "axiom"s.
%----"definition"s are used to define symbols, and are used like "axiom"s.
%----"lemma"s and "theorem"s have been proven from the "axiom"s, can be used 
%----like "axiom"s, but are redundant wrt the "axiom"s. "lemma" is used as the 
%----role of proven "lemma_conjecture"s, and "theorem" is used as the role of 
%----proven "conjecture"s, in output. A problem containing a "lemma" or 
%----"theorem" that is not redundant wrt the "axiom"s is ill-formed. "theorem"s
%----are more important than "lemma"s from the user perspective.
%----"conjecture"s occur in only FOF problems, and are to all be proven from 
%----the "axiom"(-like) formulae. A problem is solved only when all 
%----"conjecture"s are proven.
%----"lemma_conjecture"s are expected to be provable, and may be useful to 
%----prove, while proving "conjecture"s.
%----"negated_conjecture"s ocuur in only CNF problems, and are formed from
%----negation of a "conjecture" in a FOF to CNF conversion.
%----"plain"s have no special user semantics, and can be used like "axiom"s.
%----"unknown"s have unknown role, and this is an error situation.

%----FOF formulae. All formulae must be closed.
<fof formula>        ::= <binary formula> | <unitary formula>
<binary formula>     ::= <nonassoc binary> | <assoc binary>
%----Only some binary connectives are associative
%----There's no precedence amoung binary connectives
<nonassoc binary>    ::= <unitary formula> <binary connective> <unitary formula>
<binary connective>  ::= <=> | => | <= | <~> | ~<vline> | ~&
%----Associative connectives & and | are in <assoc binary>
<assoc binary>       ::= <or formula> | <and formula>
<or formula>         ::= <unitary formula> <vline> <unitary formula>
                         <more or formula>*
<more or formula>    ::= <vline> <unitary formula>
<and formula>        ::= <unitary formula> & <unitary formula>
                         <more and formula>*
<more and formula>   ::= & <unitary formula>
%----<unitary formula> are in ()s or do not have a <binary connective> at the 
%----top level.
<unitary formula>    ::= <quantified formula> | <unary formula> |
                         (<fof formula>) | <atomic formula>
<quantified formula> ::= <quantifier> [<variable list>] : <unitary formula>
<quantifier>         ::= ! | ?
%----! is universal quantification and ? is existential. Syntactically, the 
%----quantification is the left operand of :, and the <unitary formula> is 
%----the right operand. Although : is a binary operator syntactically, it is 
%----not a <binary connective>, and thus a <quantified formula> is a 
%----<unitary formula>.
%----Universal   example: ! [X,Y] : ((p(X) & p(Y)) => q(X,Y)).
%----Existential example: ? [X,Y] : (p(X) & p(Y)) & ~ q(X,Y).
%----Quantifiers have higher precedence than binary connectives, so in
%----the existential example the quantifier applies to only (p(X) & p(Y)).
<variable list>      ::= <variable> | <variable>,<variable list>
%----Future variables may have sorts and existential counting
%----Unary connectives bind more tightly than binary
<unary formula>      ::= <unary connective> <unitary formula>
<unary connective>   ::= ~

%----CNF formulae (variables implicitly universally quantified)
<cnf formula>        ::= (<disjunction>) | <disjunction>
<disjunction>        ::= <literal> <more disjunction>*
<more disjunction>   ::= <vline> <literal>
<literal>            ::= <atomic formula> | ~ <atomic formula>

%----Atoms (<predicate> is not used currently)
<atomic formula>     ::= <plain atom> | <defined atom> | <system atom>
<plain atom>         ::= <plain term>
%----A <plain atom> looks like a <plain term>, but really we mean
%----  <plain atom>         ::= <proposition> | <predicate>(<arguments>)
%----  <proposition>        ::= <atomic word>
%----  <predicate>          ::= <atomic word>
%----Using <plain term> removes a reduce/reduce ambiguity in lex/yacc.
<arguments>          ::= <term> | <term>,<arguments>
<defined atom>       ::= $true | $false |
                         <term> = <term> | <term> != <term>
%----Some systems still interprete equal/2 as equality. The use of equal/2
%----for other purposes is therefore discouraged. Please refrain from either 
%----use. Use infix '=' for equality. Note: <term> != <term> is equivalent
%----to ~ <term> = <term>
%----More defined atoms may be added in the future.
<system atom>        ::= <system term>
%----<system atom>s are used for evaluable predicates that are available
%----in particular tools. The predicate names are not controlled by the
%----TPTP syntax, so use with due care. The same is true for <system term>s.

%----Rules from here on down are for building tokens in the lexer.

%----System Comments are used for system specific annotation of anything.
%----They look like comments (see next), so by default they are discarded.
%----However, a wily user of the syntax can notice the $$ and store/extract
%----information from the "comment".
%----System specific annotations should begin $$, then identify the system,
%----followed by a :, e.g., /*$$Otter 3.3: Demodulator */
<system comment>     ::= %$$<char>*<until eoln> |
                         /<star>$$<char or eoln>*<star>/ 
%----Comments. These may be retained for non-logical purposes. Comments
%----can occur only between annotated formulae (see <TPTP input>), but
%----it seems likely that people will put them elsewhere and simply
%----strip them before tokenising.
%----A string that matches both <system comment> and <comment> should be
%----recognized as <system comment>.
